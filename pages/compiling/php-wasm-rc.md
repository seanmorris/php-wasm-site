# .php-wasm-rc

The `.php-wasm-rc` file is a configuration file that allows you to specify custom build options for php-wasm. When placed in the same directory as your project, the `php-wasm-builder` tool will use it to customize the build process.

Example `.php-wasm-rc` file:

```make
# Select a PHP version
PHP_VERSION=8.3

# Build the package to a directory other than the current one (RELATIVE path)
PHP_DIST_DIR=./public

# Build the extensions to a directory other than the current one (RELATIVE path)
PHP_ASSET_DIR=./public


# Build the cgi package to a directory other than the current one (RELATIVE path)
PHP_CGI_DIST_DIR=./public

# Build the cgi package's extensions to a directory other than the current one (RELATIVE path)
PHP_CGI_ASSET_DIR=./public

# Space separated list of files/directories (ABSOLUTE paths)
# to be included under the /preload directory in the final build.
PRELOAD_ASSETS=~/path/to/file/php-scripts ~/other-dir/example.php

# Memory to start the instance with, before growth
INITIAL_MEMORY=2048MB

# Build with assertions enabled
ASSERTIONS=0

# Select the optimization level
OPTIMIZATION=3

# Build with extensions
WITH_GD=1
WITH_LIBPNG=1
WITH_LIBJPEG=1
WITH_FREETYPE=1
```

## Options

The following options may appear in `.php-wasm-rc`.

### PRELOAD_ASSETS

Use the `PRELOAD_ASSETS` key in your `.php-wasm-rc` file to define a list of files and directories to include by default.

The files and directories will be collected into a single directory. Individual files & directories will appear in the top level, while directories will maintain their internal structure.

These files & directories will be available under `/preload` in the final package, packaged into the `.data` file that is built along with the `.wasm` file.

```bash
PRELOAD_ASSETS='/path/to/file.txt /some/directory /path/to/other_file.txt /some/other/directory'
```

### PHP_VERSION

8.0|8.1|8.2|**8.3**

---

### PHP_DIST_DIR

This is the directory where javascript & wasm files will be built to, *relative to the current directory.*

---

### PHP_ASSET_DIR

This is the directory where shared libs, extension, `.data` files & other supporting files will be built to, *relative to the current directory.* Defaults to `PHP_DIST_DIR`.

---

### OPTIMIZE

0|1|2|**3**

The optimization level to use while compiling.

---

### SUBOPTIMIZE

The optimization level to use while compiling libraries. Defaults to `OPTIMIZE`.

---

### ASSERTIONS

0|**1**

Build with/without assertions.

---

## Extension Flags

Extensions may be compiled as `dynamic`, `shared`, or `static`.

* dynamic - these extensions may be loaded selectively at runtime.
* shared - these extensions will always be loaded at startup and can be cached and reused.
* static - these extensions will be built directly into the main wasm binary (may cause a huge filesize).

(defaults provided below in **bold**)

The following options are available for building static PHP extensions:

```
WITH_BCMATH    # [0, 1] Enabled by default
WITH_CALENDAR  # [0, 1] Enabled by default
WITH_CTYPE     # [0, 1] Enabled by default
WITH_EXIF      # [0, 1] Enabled by default
WITH_FILTER    # [0, 1] Enabled by default
WITH_TOKENIZER # [0, 1] Enabled by default
WITH_VRZNO     # [0, 1] Enabled by default
```

The following extension may be compiled as static, shared or dynamic:

```
WITH_PHAR      # [0, 1, static, dynamic]
WITH_LIBXML    # [0, 1, static, shared]
WITH_ICONV     # [0, 1, static, shared, dynamic]
WITH_SQLITE    # [0, 1, static, shared, dynamic]

WITH_LIBZIP    # [0, 1, static, shared, dynamic]
WITH_ZLIB      # [0, 1, static, shared, dynamic]

WITH_GD        # [0, 1, static, shared, dynamic]
WITH_LIBPNG    # [0, 1, static, shared]
WITH_FREETYPE  # [0, 1, static, shared]
WITH_LIBJPEG   # [0, 1, static, shared]

WITH_YAML      # [0, 1, static, shared, dynamic]
WITH_TIDY      # [0, 1, static, shared, dynamic]
WITH_MBSTRING  # [0, 1, static, dynamic]
WITH_ONIGURUMA # [0, 1, static, shared]

### WITH_PHAR

static|**dynamic**

When compiled as a `dynamic` extension, this will produce the extension file `php8.x-phar.so`.

---

### WITH_LIBXML

static|**shared**

This actual `php-libxml` extension must be statically compiled, but `libxml` itself may be loaded as a shared library.

When compiled as a `shared` library, it will produce the library `libxml.so`.

---

### WITH_LIBZIP

static|shared|**dynamic**

When compiled as a `dynamic` extension, this will produce the extension `php-8.x-zip.so`.
