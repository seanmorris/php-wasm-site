Changes

## v0.2.0 - Ramifying Sympodia

* Added two runtime packages for PHP 8.0–8.5, neither of which depends on `php-wasm`. `php-sdl-wasm` is a standalone browser runtime with SDL2, SDL_image, SDL_mixer, SDL_ttf and OpenGL shader bindings (`import { PhpSdl } from 'php-sdl-wasm/php8.4-sdl.mjs'`). `php-cloud-wasm` runs PHP in Cloudflare Workers with Vrzno, zlib/ZIP and PDO-CFD1 for D1 (`import { PhpCloudflare } from 'php-cloud-wasm/php8.5-cloudflare.mjs'`). See the [SDL guide](/extensions/sdl.html) and the [Cloudflare guide](/getting-started/php-in-cloudflare.html).
* **Breaking:** SDL has moved out of `php-wasm`. The package no longer ships the `php8.x_sdl-web.mjs` runtimes; a nonempty `variant` option or `data-variant` script-tag attribute now throws a migration error. Install `php-sdl-wasm` and replace `new PhpWeb({version, variant: '_sdl', ...options})` with `new PhpSdl(options)` from the matching version's entry. This package also replaces the `php-wasm-sdl` extension shim.
* Relicensed from Apache-2.0 to `Apache-2.0 OR GPL-2.0-only`. The dual license covers the build scripts and wrapper code in every package; compiled binaries (PHP and the bundled libraries) remain under their original licenses. Each package ships `LICENSE`, `LICENSE-GPL` and `NOTICE`.
* Added `make clean-packages`, which removes every generated package file while keeping build caches, and `make release-overlay RUN_ID=<id>`, which cleans the packages and overlays the output of a successful Build Artifacts run for the current commit before publishing. `make clean` now also removes stale SDL/Cloudflare runtimes, manifests, compressed sidecars and generated test files.
* Browser CGI in a Service Worker no longer falls back to a synchronous XMLHttpRequest when the Wasm binary fails to load. Service Workers have no XMLHttpRequest, so the fallback replaced the real failure with "XMLHttpRequest is not defined"; startup now reports Emscripten's own load error. Dedicated workers keep the fallback.
* Expanded Bun testing to the shared Node/Deno suites, including extensions, documentation, packaging, CLI PHPT cases, CGI HTTP/cookies, and CommonJS/debugger coverage. CI now checks Bun 1.4.0 across PHP 8.0–8.5, all three library profiles, and raw/compressed artifacts, with fast wrapper and build-helper checks before native builds.
* Fixed embedded-editor highlighting and false EOF diagnostics for indented PHP heredoc/nowdoc endings followed by expressions. Ace syntax validation remains enabled, including errors after the string.
* Fixed closed SDL_mixer cleanup replacing the existing error and retaining a stale audio format. Decoder initialization after shutdown no longer recreates decoder lists; repeated PHP refresh stays at zero SDL allocations, and reopening supports a different audio format.
* Browser, worker, webview and debugger runtimes now use the existing local lock fallback when Web Locks are unavailable, including HTTP LAN testing on iOS. Worker/webview refresh also waits for filesystem synchronization before releasing its lock. The fallback coordinates one page or worker; cross-context locking still requires Web Locks.
* Fixed SDL keyboard capture swallowing other page editors: native keys now follow canvas/IME focus, and leaving that target releases held keys and modifiers.
* SDL_image now aborts short PNG reads through libpng cleanup, with valid-image recovery checked after truncated headers, image data and CRCs.
* Fixed an SDL_mixer leak when chunk format detection fails: owned input streams now close on that failure path. Repeated malformed image/font/audio tests cover native allocations, file descriptors, decoder recovery and borrowed/owned RWops behavior.
* Isolated PHP configure caches by version and configure settings, fixing iconv detection when switching between PHP releases. SDL JavaScript changes now relink runtime outputs without reconfiguring PHP or recompiling unchanged C sources. The existing fast CI gate checks cache selection and all 32 runtime link targets.
* Hardened SDL pointer-lock requests and teardown. Unsupported/no-window requests return SDL errors, browser Promise rejection is handled, and deferred/late work is tied to window ownership. Window/video/request cleanup releases the SDL canvas without unlocking another element.
* Connected SDL text-input start/stop and candidate rectangles to browser Unicode/composition input, preserving physical keys and native UTF-8 event splitting. Window/video/request teardown retires editing callbacks. Fullscreen IME uses EditContext; browsers without it report the limitation and retain ordinary keypress input.
* Fixed SDL fullscreen on canvases with empty/custom IDs and in shadow roots. Unavailable or policy-blocked fullscreen changes return an SDL error. Window/video teardown and PHP refresh cancel delayed style/resize work before native window data is freed, preserving newly created windows.
* Added immutable, volume and array OpenGL texture storage/uploads, checked compressed transfers, and context-owned samplers with scalar parameter queries. Pixel transfers support checked row/image offsets and padding; surface uploads preserve unpack state and readback never exposes uninitialized gaps.
* Fixed SDL WebGL context restoration by retiring invalidated GPU names, resetting cached bindings and restoring automatically enabled extensions. Applications can recreate ordinary/compressed textures and render targets after restoration; GPU assets still need to be reloaded by the application.
* Added SDL window/logical coordinate conversions with fractional viewport and scaling support, checked numeric bounds, and safe output references.
* Stopped SDL window garbage collection from refreshing native properties or invoking their PHP destructors. This fixes PHP 8.0 collection crashes and preserves live property values on newer PHP versions.
* Closed PHP 8.0 subclass serialization bypasses for SDL native resource handles while preserving valid subclasses and ordinary value-object serialization. Shared guards also make crafted object payloads fail with catchable exceptions; PHP 8.1+ retains its existing class-flag behavior.
* Hardened SDL window aliases, subclass conversion, constructor reentry, property callbacks and typed outputs. Rectangle updates validate counts and reject targets changed by getters. Window and input handles reject ownership copying; repeated window destruction is harmless and native creation errors remain visible.
* Hardened SDL_mixer ownership, stale channel aliases, channel bounds, callback outputs and audio restarts. Unused audio objects release on last PHP reference; channels and active music retain playback. Freeing or replacing fading music returns while browser audio is suspended. Final audio shutdown invalidates loaded objects and PHP refresh closes every mixer open reference. Mixer RWops loaders snapshot input before native decoding; pre-video cursor selection now fails safely.
* Corrected SDL cursor construction, aliases, video teardown and native cleanup. Bitmap dimensions, hotspots and system IDs are checked; cloning, serialization and reinitialization are rejected. Cursor visibility queries no longer change visibility and return the pinned SDL integer state. Mouse outputs respect typed references and callback exceptions. SDL input callbacks follow the supplied canvas, including custom IDs and shadow roots.
* Hardened SDL RWops allocation, memory ownership and PHP stream callbacks; BMP loaders close aliases consistently and snapshot source pixels across callbacks. Invalid ranges now raise exceptions, zero-length transfers are no-ops, and unsigned reads outside PHP's integer range return exact decimal strings. SDL_ttf fonts now follow initialization counts and ordinary PHP ownership, with callback and typed-output lifetime checks.
* Fixed SDL pixel conversion writing into the source, uninitialized blit destination rectangles, stale surface/format/palette views, and renderer callbacks using destroyed resources. Views retain their owners and reject explicit/native teardown; checked conversions support overlapping buffers. Texture-lock output failures preserve newer locks created by callbacks.
* Fixed SDL GL context construction, ownership and borrowed-alias invalidation. Window/video teardown releases remaining PHP-created GPU resources, while subsystem reference counts preserve live contexts. Context-changing output destructors and deleted shader/program handles now fail with catchable PHP errors; rectangular matrix setters reject WebGL1 safely.
* Added checked SDL triangle geometry and packed-buffer drawing, integer/float primitive batches, and renderer capability, color/blend, viewport, clipping and scaling controls. Batches reject invalid buffers and keep renderer lifetime checks valid across PHP property callbacks.
* Added checked WebGL2 instancing, integer vertex attributes, uniform buffers and reflection, exact unsigned uniforms, depth/stencil/multisample renderbuffers, framebuffer resolve, and multiple render targets. Typed state queries return correctly sized scalar or array results. New WebGL2 operations report a catchable error when given a WebGL1 context.
* Filled out SDL event payloads, safe streaming textures, UTF-8 font rendering/metrics/styles, standard controller polling, OpenGL uniform variants, and precise timers. The cube uses native bold/outline fonts for its cyan/white/sand text scroller. Texture/window/controller teardown invalidates handles safely; SDL surface blits now honor destination rectangles.
* SDL_mixer now decodes MP3 through its bundled minimp3 implementation. The cube plays the supplied **Unreal Superhero 3** by **Kenët and rez** and displays the artist credit from the file's ID3 tags.
* Embedded PHP links now store source in the URL fragment, avoiding request-header limits while preserving old query links. The SDL cube fills its preview and adapts its viewport, perspective, and text overlay to resizing without interpolating its pixel-art texture.
* Expanded the `_sdl` browser runtime with SDL_image, SDL_mixer, SDL_ttf, and PHP 8 OpenGL shader bindings through the existing Make build. The SDL Cube demo uses the `sean-icon-32` texture with nearest filtering, text, focused keyboard controls, and audio after a user gesture. Added resource cleanup, context recovery, checked asset loading, and PHP 8.0–8.5 coverage across all three library profiles. See [SDL and OpenGL](/extensions/sdl.html) for availability, build flags, supported APIs, and measurements.
* Made the CGI queue timing tests portable to pinned Deno 2.5.6 without changing the 25 ms idle wait or 250 ms processing bound. The fast Deno gate now includes the queue suite before native builds.
* Browser CGI now journals filesystem mutations and commits only changed IDBFS records, avoiding full-tree scans at the end of each request. Existing storage remains compatible. Failed commits retain changes for retry; renamed trees, native writes, metadata, symlinks and deletions are covered by browser persistence tests. Symlinks hydrate their own metadata without following their targets.
* Restored the browser CGI filesystem queue's 25 ms idle batching window. Concurrent calls share hydration and persistence, mixed read/write batches always commit, and acknowledgments wait for the shared commit. Failed commits reject the whole batch, and bounded batches release the lock for other work. HTTP CGI requests retain their per-request flush.
* Recover failed CGI startup with two automatic retries after 1 and 2 seconds, including registration and replacement failures. Saved files are preserved; a manual startup retry appears only after all three attempts fail. Framework and VS Code startup share the readiness check. Worker assets use flat hashed paths so Vite serves rebuilt dependencies reliably.
* Added typed directory listings with `readdir(path, {withFileTypes: true})` across runtime wrappers and declarations. Browser CGI reads refresh storage without flushing, and writes still wait for persistence. The VS Code bridge forwards listing options so updated File Bus hosts can expand and search directories without per-entry RPCs.
* Expanded the lightweight editor's file handling with explicit Save, untitled documents, file/folder operations, transfers, recovery, and conflict checks. Empty workspaces retain a saveable untitled document. Removed the redundant standalone Waitline link from the home-page extras.
* Fixed the lightweight editor's Files menu and debugger prompt overflowing on narrow screens.
* Expanded PDO-CFD1 with named/numbered parameters, direct execution, quoting, insert IDs, binary values, buffered scroll cursors, and result metadata. Atomic `cfd1Batch()` reuses bound PDO statements; ordinary `execute([...])` remains available without explicit binding.
* Cloudflare builds now use the ordinary Make/Docker Compose flow and a selectable configuration file. The CLI honors `.php-wasm-rc`; shared build workspaces preserve incremental native state across unchanged builds and isolate different configurations. Packaging leaves the raw JavaScript/Wasm pair intact.
* Fixed the nightly PHP information page's embedded logos by permitting data images in its Content Security Policy.
* Nightly Cloudflare deployment now reconciles versioned cache rules for encoding-aware downloads and uncached PHP/D1, preserving unrelated zone rules and purging only the release's manifest URLs. CI requires the zone-scoped cache token and zone ID documented in `CLOUDFLARE.md`.
* Nightly verification checks repeated identity/Brotli/gzip downloads at the same URL, HEAD responses, encoding exclusions and public CDN cache hits. Phase diagnostics retain the failing URL, encoding, HTTP/network error, cache status and first retry failure. A read-only verification CLI rechecks uploaded releases; bounded retries and automatic Pages rollback remain in place.
* Consolidated the PGlite, CFD1, Vrzno, and Waitline source importers and their regression fixtures. Each package command passes its policy to one shared importer in the builder workspace; refs, input policies, manifests, and build behavior are preserved. CI covers checkout, installed builder, Cloudflare snapshot, and Docker ownership layouts, including CFD1. See the [importer maintenance notes](https://github.com/seanmorris/php-wasm/blob/develop/bin/README.md).
* Import the PHP 8.0–8.5 PDO-CFD1 driver directly from its upstream commit. The driver fixes and unit tests now live in PDO-CFD1; php-wasm no longer applies or ships a compatibility patch. Existing imported-source manifests migrate to the direct source on the next build.
* Corrected runtime declarations and package exports for Deno, TypeScript Bundler/NodeNext resolution, and CommonJS. Existing wrapper import paths remain supported; CommonJS entrypoints now select matching `.d.cts` declarations. Constructor values come from the wrapper modules, while `public` exposes types.
* TypeScript consumers should await `tokenize()` for its serialized string result, use the metadata returned by `mkdir()`, and expect unsigned `HEAPU8` bytes. `readFile()` now distinguishes UTF-8 text from binary bytes; `writeFile()` accepts strings and ArrayBuffer views, matching Emscripten FS.
* CLI `run()` accepts optional string flags. Node CLI can resolve to `undefined` for runtime errors without an exit status; browser CLI rejects those errors. Embedded `run()` requires PHP source. Browser refresh methods return `Promise<void>`, embedded refresh returns a numeric result, and CGI refresh returns its binary. CGI `putEnv()` returns a number, and CGI wrappers do not inherit `EventTarget`. Debugger declarations now include `isRunning()`, synchronous `dumpSymbols()`, optional symbol tables, file arrays, and structured backtraces.
* Added `npm run test:types` with pinned Deno 2.5.6, strict isolated npm fixtures, declaration checking, and coverage for all six generated Cloudflare versions. Both CI workflows run these checks before native builds. Regenerate CommonJS declarations and export mappings with `npm run generate:types`.
* Artifact packaging now stages every declared wrapper with `make runtime-wrappers`, independent of the selected native profile. The isolated type fixtures use the same Make target and verify every explicit package export is present in the npm tarball.
* Dynamic extensions and support libraries now preserve their native frames when PHP callbacks await JavaScript. This fixes crashes when libxml warning handlers perform asynchronous work, such as database logging. Rebuild side modules with the current Make flags.
* Asyncify import rejections and failed unwinds or rewinds now reach the caller with the original error. Failed instances reject later native calls. CGI returns a non-cacheable HTTP 500 and replaces the runtime before queued requests proceed; replacement initialization failures also produce HTTP 500 responses.

## v0.1.0 - Aiming for the (GitHub) Stars

* Rebuilt `demo-web` around Vite, reorganized it into `pages`, `components`, `lib`, and `assets`, and added the newer browser/e2e harnesses plus runtime path helpers for the worker and page builds.
* Added Quickbus-backed browser messaging, a richer `phpdbg` bus session, and a VSCode debugger bridge for the demo app and debugger workflow.
* Expanded runtime/build coverage across older targets, including `phpdbg`, SDL, and Vrzno support in PHP `8.0` builds. SDL now ships as the `_sdl` runtime variant instead of a separately loaded shared library.
* Added `version` and `variant` support to `php-tags`, making it possible to select non-default runtimes from static HTML.
* Standardized the maintained runtime sources on `.mjs` modules and expanded type/JSDoc coverage across `php-wasm`, `php-cgi-wasm`, `php-cli-wasm`, `php-dbg-wasm`, and the extension helper packages.
* Reworked shared and dynamic extension loading so built-in support libraries, ICU payloads, OpenSSL, libxml/XML, DOM, SimpleXML, XMLReader, and XMLWriter behave consistently across Node, browser, demo, and docs/test harnesses.
* Suppressed implicit `libxml2.so` loading when it is not provided in `sharedLibs`, which reduces startup download size for minimal runtime configurations.
* Broadened verification with vendored `php-wasm-site` docs fixtures, split docs/CGI coverage suites, deeper CLI-node PHPT coverage, richer XML/intl/tidy/iconv/sqlite smoke tests, and browser-test race-condition fixes.
* Added `require()` support and CJS harness coverage for the core Node runtimes, documented manual extension asset wiring for CommonJS consumers, standardized `LIB_TYPE` as the static/shared/dynamic selector, and left `BUILD_TYPE` as the JS/MJS wrapper-format selector.
* Improved local workspace and release plumbing with symlink-aware package loading, action-artifact overlay support, and refreshed README/package docs around runtime defaults, versioned `.wasm` assets, extension wiring, interactive CLI/debugger behavior via `waitline`, and Cloudflare D1 setup through `pdo_cfd1`.

## v0.0.9 - Here there be dragons
