# Using PHP Extensions

Extension helper JS packages are provided as ESM modules.

Those helper modules rely on `import.meta.url` to resolve their static assets, so there is no universal CommonJS equivalent for them.

If you need to bypass the helper packages, you can still provide the underlying `.so`, `.data`, `.wasm`, and support-library assets manually through the runtime constructors.

You can pass an array as the `sharedLibs` argument to the constructor from Javascript to automatically generate an ini file that loads your extensions.

```javascript
import libxml from 'php-wasm-libxml';
import dom from 'php-wasm-dom';

const php = new PhpWeb({sharedLibs: [
	libxml,
	dom,
]});
```

You can also use the `dynamicLibs` argument to get similar behavior **without** automatically loading the extension. A PHP script can call the `dl()` function to dynamically load the extension at runtime:

```javascript
import libxml from 'php-wasm-libxml';
import dom from 'php-wasm-dom';

const php = new PhpWeb({dynamicLibs: [
	libxml,
	dom,
]});
```

```php
<?php
// Load the extension at runtime
dl('php8.4-dom.so');
```

Versioned extension filenames must match the active runtime version. If you switch away from the default `8.4` runtime, update `php8.4-*.so` examples accordingly.

Shared builds work a little differently from dynamic ones. In `shared` builds, many common extensions are already compiled into the base runtime, so only third-party support libraries should be injected at startup. For example, `intl` in shared mode still needs the ICU `libicu*.so` files and `icudt72l.dat`, but it should not try to load `php8.x-intl.so` a second time. Shared `intl` should get the data file the same way dynamic builds do: preload `icudt72l.dat` into `/preload` at startup.

The same distinction applies to SSL/TLS support. In static and shared runtime variants, OpenSSL support and its backing libraries may already be linked into the base runtime, while dynamic builds still rely on the `php-wasm-openssl` package and explicit support-library loading.

Static builds are the exception for `intl`: they can bundle `icudt72l.dat` directly into the runtime `.data` payload instead of fetching it separately.

## Dynamic Imports for Extensions

You can also load extensions modules dynamically:

```javascript
// This will load both sqlite.so & php8.x-sqlite.so:
const php = new PhpWeb({sharedLibs: [
	await import('https://unpkg.com/php-wasm-sqlite')
]});
```

Unfortunately, this notation is not available for Service Workers, as they do not yet support dynamic `imports()`. Hopefully this will change soon.

## Loading extensions manually


If you want to bypass the helper packages, you can provide the extensions manually.

```javascript
import { PhpNode } from 'php-wasm/PhpNode';

const php = new PhpNode({
  sharedLibs: [
    {
      name: 'php8.4-sqlite.so',
      url: new URL('./vendor/php8.4-sqlite.so', import.meta.url).href,
      ini: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'libsqlite3.so',
      url: new URL('./vendor/libsqlite3.so', import.meta.url).href,
    },
  ],
});
```

This manual asset path is also where library mode matters most:

- `dynamic`: provide the extension `.so` plus any support libraries and preload files it needs
- `shared`: provide only the extra support libraries and preload files the runtime still needs
- `static`: do not inject the extension assets again

### CommonJS Node manual assets

CommonJS consumers should treat the extension helper JS packages as ESM-only and load extension assets manually:

```javascript
const path = require('node:path');
const { pathToFileURL } = require('node:url');
const { PhpNode } = require('php-wasm/PhpNode');

const asset = file => pathToFileURL(
  path.resolve(__dirname, 'vendor', file)
).href;

const php = new PhpNode({
  sharedLibs: [
    {
      name: 'php8.5-sqlite.so',
      url: asset('php8.5-sqlite.so'),
      ini: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'libsqlite3.so',
      url: asset('libsqlite3.so'),
      ini: false,
    },
  ],
});
```

If an extension also needs preload files such as `icudt72l.dat`, provide those through `files`. If you need to override where the base runtime discovers `.wasm`, `.data`, or supporting assets, use `locateFile`.


The first codeblock is shorthand for the second. Passing `ini: true` will automatically load the extension via `/php.ini`, passing `ini: false` will wait for a call to `dl()` to do the lookup.

```javascript
const php = new PhpWeb({sharedLibs: [ await import('https://unpkg.com/php-wasm-sqlite') ]});
```

Supporting libraries should **not** be loaded via `ini`.

```javascript
const php = new PhpWeb({sharedLibs: [
	{
		name: `php8.4-sqlite.so`,
		url:  `https://unpkg.com/php-wasm-sqlite/php8.4-sqlite.so`,
		ini:  true,
	},
	{	
		name: 'sqlite.so',
		url: 'https://unpkg.com/php-wasm-sqlite/sqlite.so',
		ini: false 
	}
]});
```

Strings starting with `/`, `./`, `http://` or `https://` will be treated as URLs:

```javascript
const php = new PhpWeb({sharedLibs: [
	`./php8.4-phar.so`
]});
```

Some extensions require supporting libraries. You can provide URLs for those as `sharedLibs` as well, just pass `ini: false`:

*(`name` is implied to be the last section of the URL here.)*

```javascript
const php = new PhpWeb({sharedLibs: [
	{ url: 'https://unpkg.com/php-wasm-sqlite/php8.4-sqlite.so', ini: true  },
	{ url: 'https://unpkg.com/php-wasm-sqlite/sqlite.so',        ini: false },
]});
```

## Extension List

The following extensions may be loaded at runtime. This allows the shared extensions and their dependencies to be cached, reused, and selected à la carte for each application
